**About the dataset:**

The data contains mock train ticket sales for National Rail in the UK, from January to April 2024, including details on the type of ticket, the date & time for each journey, the departure & arrival stations, the ticket price, and more.

**Objective:**

In this Maven Rail Challenge, I am taking on the role of a BI Developer for National Rail, a company offering business services to passenger train operators in England, Scotland, and Wales.

My task is to create an **exploratory dashboard** that helps to:
Identify the most popular routes
Determine peak travel times
Analyze revenue from different ticket types and classes
Diagnose on-time performance and contributing factors

I used Microsoft **Power BI** to analyze the dataset and build a dashboard, performing various data cleaning and transformation steps to meet the project requirements.


**Key insights**

Most popular route was Manchester Piccadilly to Liverpool Lime Street, with a trip count of 4628

Peak travel times were morning(06:00) and evening(18:00) with the highest numbers of departures occurring during these hours

Highest revenue was from Advance Ticket Type with $309K and Standard Ticket Class with $593K

A total of  86.82% of trips were on-time , 7.24% trips were delayed and 5.94% were cancelled. Weather conditions, signal failures and technical issues were the reasons for most of the delays

**Recommendations:**


There were refund requests primarily due to delays and cancellations, which resulted in revenue loss. Hence, signaling system should be improved and special attention is required to address technical issues


Proper staff training and increase staffing during the peak hours is required to reduce delays and elevate service reliability


Provide special offers to encourage more travelers to select First Class, thereby increasing revenue from premium-priced tickets.
